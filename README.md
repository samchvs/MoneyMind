MoneyMind, an AI-powered mobile budgeting application, provides personalized financial budgeting recommendations based on the user’s income, expenses, and saving habits. Unlike traditional budgeting approaches that utilize a one-size-fits-all approach, MoneyMind leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the user’s past financial data and creates a customized budget plan.

This project was created using React Native Expo

To Run:
- Install React Native Expo  
- Install all the dependencies  
- npm start  
  
Note:
This mobile application was created as a requirement for one of our class. This was rushed so the designs/layout were not polished but fully functional! 
We also created two separate AI applications for this app: chatbot and AI budgeting generation. Once not busy anymore, will try to polish this more and integrate both AI integrations into one!
